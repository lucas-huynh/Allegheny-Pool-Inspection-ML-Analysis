- Final Write-up:

## Project Overview

This project analyzes public swimming pool, hot tub, and spa inspection records in Allegheny County. Our goal was to build a machine learning pipeline to predict whether a facility will pass inspection, identify key predictors, and support policy/inspection improvements through interpretable models.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `inspection_data.csv`: Raw input data
- `ml_project_final.ipynb`: Final notebook including preprocessing, modeling, and interpretation

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have:

- Anaconda or Python 3.8+
- Your working directory set to the location of the notebook

## Installation of Required Modules

This project requires the following Python modules:

- **pandas**
- **numpy**
- **matplotlib**
- **seaborn**
- **scikit-learn** (includes: `pipeline`, `model_selection`, `metrics`, `preprocessing`, `decomposition`, etc.)
- **xgboost**
- **lightgbm**
- **shap**

> **Note**: The following modules are part of the Python standard library and do **not** require separate installation:
- `csv`
- `json`
- `re`
- `time`
- `math`
